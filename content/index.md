Other options for search-engine spiderability
---------

There are other options to serve up static content for the search engine bots - my searches tearned up [BromBone](http://www.brombone.com/) and [seo4ajax](http://www.seo4ajax.com).

If most of your traffic comes from Google, it may not even matter - they recently announced that their spiders will be [executing JavaScript](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.co.uk/2014/05/understanding-web-pages-better.html).

Who is it for?
=========

Well, it's for me, obviously.  I'm planning on using it for all my personal sites where I would have previously used Wordpress or MediaWiki.

Buuuuut I figured there might be other people who would be interested in those same features that I wanted, so here we are.

Even if it doesn't make sense for your own blog, if you want a light-weight wiki where people make contributions via something like Github as pull requests or merges (no more worrying about spam, or MediaWiki user privileges!) you may want to try it out.

Tell me what you think!
=========

[Hit me up on Twitter](https://twitter.com/TehShrike) or <a href="mailto:me@JoshDuff.com">send me an email</a>!  The Github repository is [right over here](https://github.com/TehShrike/noddity) and would love for strangers to touch it.

Thanks

Noddity relies very heavily on:

- [browserify](http://browserify.org/)
- [LevelUP](https://github.com/rvagg/node-levelup)
- [Ractive.js](http://www.ractivejs.org/)

Special thanks to [James Halliday](http://substack.net/), [Rod Vagg](http://r.va.gg/), and [Rich Harris](http://www.rich-harris.co.uk/), who are fantastic people making the internet a better place to code.
